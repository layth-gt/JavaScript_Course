//  Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
//Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title. Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
var numberOfChildren = 2;
var partnerName = "Baydah";
var geolocation = "Sydney";
var jobTitle = "Designer";
var fortune = ("You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + geolocation + " and married to " + partnerName + " with " + numberOfChildren + " kids");
